Place media assets here used by the site:

- headshot-placeholder.jpg   (replace with a square headshot ~400x400). Resize the image to the displayed size before adding to avoid large downloads.
- fun1.jpg, fun2.jpg, fun3.jpg, fun4.jpg  (photos used on the Fun page)
- project-finals.jpg, project-secretsanta.jpg, project-eventbased.jpg  (placeholder images for Projects page)

Guidelines (assignment requirements):
- Use only HTML and CSS you write yourself. The only allowed external framework is Foundation 6 (if you choose to use it). Do NOT include other external CSS/JS libraries.
- Use relative paths for links and images.
- Ensure images are resized to the display size (edit them locally) to avoid large downloads.
- File names: avoid spaces, use lowercase and dashes.

Drop the images here and the site will reference them via relative paths.
